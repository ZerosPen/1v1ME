INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Print either "Vote Rock Paper Scissors Filled Cards.pdf"
   or "Vote Rock Paper Scissors Blank Cards.pdf", centered
   and double-sided, on the heaviest card you can.

   The "Filled Cards" .pdf will give you 30 cards, 10
   each of rock, paper and scissors, the same amount
   of cards used for one round in the anime. The "Blank
   Cards" .pdf has two pairs of pages, one for 6 cards and
   one for 3. Depending on the amount of blank cards you'd
   like to print, choose a pair to print (pages 1 and 2, or
   pages 3 and 4), and make the appropriate number of
   copies (for the 30 cards used per round in the anime,
   make 5 copies of pages 1 and 2).

   It helps to do a test print of the last two pages (the
   three cards, front and back) on regular paper in black
   and white to make sure your settings are all proper
   to waste a minimal amount of ink and paper.

2. Carefully cut along the red lines; scissors or a craft
   knife work perfectly for this, but a proper paper cutter
   makes this extremely fast, easy, and accurate.

3. If you have one, use a scrapbook corner cutting tool to
   round the edges; if you don't have one, you should get
   one!! They're really cheap and they'll make your print
   and play cards much nicer to use and look at, as well as
   more durable.

4. That's it! Enjoy your cards! Send me a picture!

VOTE ROCK PAPER SCISSORS
------------------------------------------------------------
In the Kakegurui anime, there are 30 students who "vote" on
cards, so I decided to make the main deck consist of 30
cards, using the drawn designs from the anime. I decided to
include cards with designs already on them despite the cards
in the show being blank because it's probably a little
impractical for most people to play the game how it's
depicted. :^)

There are an equal amount of rock, paper, and scissors
cards, so the game should be a little more fair than in the
show. There are also blank cards in two quantities, so if
you actually can and want to play "authentic" Vote Rock
Paper Scissors you can.

BLANK CARDS, INDIVIDUAL CARDS, + PERMISSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to make your own custom cards using the backs,
I've included the .png files for the backs and the matching
template for the front of the cards. I've also included .pngs
of each individual card, and the back. Do what you want with
them! Have fun! I spent a lot of time on the cards so I'm
glad you're putting them to use! The only things I ask:

1. Don't sell the Vote Rock Paper Scissors cards, either
   printed or the .pdf!!

2. If you use the cards or the backs for a project that's
   just for yourself or to distribute for free, please send
   me your project! I wanna see! And please link back to the
   itch.io page for the Vote Rock Paper Scissors cards.

3. If you want to use the backs for your own cards that you
   intend to sell, send me an email and we can chat.


------------------------------------------------------------
A BOX?
------------------------------------------------------------
I didn't include a printable box in the files because there
wasn't a box shown in the anime to copy, but if you'd like
a box for the Vote Rock Paper Scissors cards (or any other
PnP cards! It's a really handy site!), you can generate a
printable template here:
